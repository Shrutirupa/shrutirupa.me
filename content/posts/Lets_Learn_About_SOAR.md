<p>
After learning about the kinds of threats and what could be done by an organization in the previous <a href="https://shrutirupa.me/posts/ "> blog posts</a>, we are getting into more details about the same. In this post, we will learn about SOAR which is yet another corporate jargon, that should never be missed by a security professional.
</p>
<p>
Let’s break it down and understand the meaning one by one.
</p>
<p>
SOAR is one solution to improve the effectiveness of cyber-security operations. 
</p>
<p>
The full form of SOAR is  Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response.
</p>
<p>
Well, each of the terminologies mentioned is enough to give us all an idea of what it does, we will definitely, dig a bit deeper to understand more simply. </p>
<p>
Let’s go one at a time.
</p>
<p>
The definition of Orchestration is properly coordinating the entire security practices. </p>
<p>By Automation, we mean to automate the tasks which were done manually and would take some time for easy and further analysis. </p>
<p>
Response means the results that we will be getting and hence further generating them based on the above automation and analysis.
</p>
<p>
Let’s now combine each of them and bring out a meaningful definition of SOAR and how it is helping in improving the security practices of an organization.
</p>
<p>
So, SOAR can be considered as software helping an organization to collect security threats or data from different resources.  Once these threats are collected, they are then analyzed with the help of automation scripts which are based on a defined workflow created. This does not require much human intervention.
Based on the above automation, an incident response analysis is done. </p>
<p>
All of the above processes work with the help of a standard workflow, we call it a playbook.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally, a SOC analyst would be monitoring the network all the time, keep looking for the alerts getting generated. Since alerts get generated, there’s a huge scope for false positives. So the analyst will have to then analyze the same, and work for the actions to be taken as remediations in case of an actual alert.
</p>
<p>
What does an alert mean? </p>
<p>
When a malicious actor is trying to compromise the organization internally, externally, through the network, the process followed generates an alert. This alert gets generated in an organization only if some WAF(Web Application Firewall) or IDS(Intrusion Detection System) or IPS(Intrusion Prevention System), etc is implemented.
</p>
<p>
Now, who is a SOC Analyst? </p>
<p>
A SOC Analyst is a security professional who keeps monitoring the threats to an organization and based on them assesses security policies and measures to be implemented for protecting the organization.
</p>
<p>
Thus, SOAR is simply easing the task by automating everything. It has connectors to glue all the devices required for security purposes in the organization. Instances of security devices can be firewalls, IDS(Intrusion Detection System), IPS(Intrusion Prevention System), and many more.
</p>
<p>
Why do we need to automate all these? </p>
<p>Because an organization has lots of networking devices. We did learn about different nodes and security threats in the previous <a href="https://shrutirupa.me/posts/ "> blog posts</a>. </p>
<p>
SOAR is simply an incident - response life cycle, helping to automate the security practices by following the detection analysis that used to happen manually.
</p>
<p>
What is an incident - response life cycle? </p>
<p>
It is an organized process dealing with security incidents. And based on these incidents, responses are made that looks after the preparation for these incidents, analysis of them, and how to remediate the organization completely from this. 
</p>
<p>
While concluding, we can say that automation can never be left alone, without a little touch of manual work, we are simply easing the long processed tasks in a structured way so that more and more security issues can be covered and taken care of. It is an important step for every organization out there, big or small, to implement such strong security practices to reduce the chances of any security risk in future.
