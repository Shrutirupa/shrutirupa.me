<p> Every day we come across a new kind of vulnerability or a zero-day attack on an application. It is quite known that nothing is 100% secure. We do observe different kinds of data breaches or accounts getting compromised. And this is something unacceptable. Every organization implements a new policy based on the recent hacks or threats, that they may or may not have suffered from. And of course, there has to be a long term solution to it. </p>

<p> Obviously, we can't expect the hackers to stop hacking but we can definitely, implement a stronger security model.
Initially, the organizations had a perimeter-based network. And this classic security model would only implement a firewall or Just an IDS or IPS. 
But now proper security measures have to be implemented at each step. It was believed that everything within our network is secure. But this is not the case anymore. Thus, the zero-trust security model comes into play. Under this model, everything is considered to be an attack vector. Everything, big or small is a threat i.e. everything connected to an enterprise is untrusted until proved otherwise.
Good security practices have to be implemented both internally and externally. 
Nothing is to be trusted and everything has to be verified. 
</p>
<p>
So for implementing such strong measures, the following could be some of the solutions:
</p>
<p>
SSO - It stands for Single Sign-On. As the term signifies it is talking about a centralized i.e. single system that uses a single set of credentials(sign-on)  for multiple applications. 
</p>
<p>
Multi-factor authentication - The term "multi-factor" here suggests that a user has to prove their authenticity multiple times to the website or the application. 

The above two measures talk about the authentication of a user to protect an organization from any identity theft-related issues. Improper implementation of the above two measures may allow any random and malicious user to get into the network and hence, compromise the enterprise.
</p>
<p>
Privileges - This talks about the privileges provided to a user in an application. 
The user may have lower privileges and hence doesn't have the right to access the privileges of an admin, say, and this leads to the implementation of proper authorization measures within the organization.
</p>
<p>
Micro-segmentation - This is one important security practice which is dividing the network into smaller segments so that each segment can be segregated from one another. 
It takes care of the proper implementation of the access control mechanism in the organization. Taking a deep dive into this process, we can comprehend that if one of the segments gets compromised in any way, it doesn't affect the other segments, and this helps the organization to only look after the affected segment, hence decreasing the workload along with increasing the security aspect.
</p>
<p>
Monitoring - After implementing some good security practices, it is always important to keep a log of the activities of the users who are using the organizationâ€™s devices or network or both. Logs have to be maintained and monitored. 
This is the most important step to be followed at any cost. And as has already been mentioned before "Nothing is to be trusted and everything has to be verified". 
</p>
<p>
The above-mentioned points are some of the measures which should be implemented in an organization for stronger security. As nothing is completely secured, and also not everything is trustworthy, so it's important to follow good security practices and reasonable policies and the zero-trust security model does focus on the same.
