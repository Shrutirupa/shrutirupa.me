In our day to day lives, we keep hearing news about the data breach, accounts getting compromised, keeping our passwords stronger, and so on, what do all these remind us of???
</p>
Again, the same old thing, nothing is 100% secure. 
<p>
In the previous blog, I wrote about <a href="https://shrutirupa.me/posts/advanced_persistent_threats/ "> APT </a> and inferred how such threats are compromising the organizations to a whole new level, and this is the reason why we are talking about threat intelligence.
</p>
<p>
Letâ€™s break the terms and comprehend what is it certainly trying to convey.
As the terms suggest, threat means danger and intelligence means having knowledge related to the subject.
So threat intelligence means knowledge that an enterprise collects and then uses to analyze the threats that it may have so that any future risk could be mitigated and taken care of. 
</p>
<p>
Let us understand some basic steps, roughly that are followed for threat intelligence.
</p>
<p>
Identify - The organizations have to identify the point which could be a risk factor for them. They have to look into every minute detail to identify any scope of attack that could be possible against them. Using outdated software can be one instance, and so is untrained employees.
</p>
<p>
Analyze - Next is to understand the probability of how severe the damage could be. This prospect can help the organization to set their priorities on point. Of course, a minute risk is never subject to ignorance, but a step-by-step approach, towards setting up the priority from high to low, can serve the purpose more clearly.
</p>
<p>
Prevent - Once understood, the step is to prevent risk. We already know that prevention is always better than cure. So the enterprises need to be proactive with proper predictions to prevent future attacks. Nothing is 100% secure but we do need to keep an eye on every factor.
</p>
<p>
Threat intelligence also comes in the form of different categories. These categories are differentiated based on how technical or how operational the attack scenario can get. The attackers can find some serious technical flaws in any of the applications or products used by the organization and this may lead to the compromise of the system. Some of them may be related to social engineering or proper strategies, or some may try to get through malware, few loopholes can be found from some low-level strategies not being followed in an organized way by the enterprises as well.
</p>
<p>
While concluding, one thing that I would like to strengthen on is threat intelligence is a practice that every enterprise, big or small, should follow. With the era of evolving technologies and more and more dependencies upon it, this should, certainly, be the need of the hour.
